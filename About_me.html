         <p>Hi! My name is Abby, this is my second semester at BYUI and I am loving it! My current career path is Special Education. I love learning new things and I like to poke at computers and figure out how things work. In my free time I usualy craft and find something new to keep my brain stimulated. Curretly a single pringle and I am cool with that. It is my opinion that learning technology skills will be very important for the future. And I think learning about computers is fun, but career things are becoming more tech based. My family, including me, have been memebers for my life and I love the church and it brings me great joy.</p>
